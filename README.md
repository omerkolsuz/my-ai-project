This is a example code:
```
dclass Task:
    def __init__(self, description, deadline, priority):
        self.description = description
        self.deadline = deadline
        self.priority = priority

class TaskMaster:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []

    def add_task(self, task):
        self.tasks.append(task)

    def list_tasks(self):
        for index, task in enumerate(self.tasks, start=1):
            print(f"Task {index}: {task.description} - Deadline: {task.deadline} - Priority: {task.priority}")

# Skapa en instans av TaskMaster
tm = TaskMaster()

# Lägg till några uppgifter
task1 = Task("Köp mat", "2024-04-20", "Hög")
task2 = Task("Ring tandläkaren", "2024-04-18", "Medium")

tm.add_task(task1)
tm.add_task(task2)

# Lista alla uppgifter
tm.list_tasks()

```
## Data sources and AI methods
TaskMaster relies on user-provided data, such as task descriptions, deadlines, and priorities. AI techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms are utilized to analyze and organize tasks effectively. The solution may also integrate with external calendars and productivity tools to enhance functionality.
## Challenges
While TaskMaster provides valuable assistance in task management, it does not solve all challenges related to productivity and time management. Limitations include the need for continuous updates and improvements to enhance accuracy and relevance. Ethical considerations include data privacy and security, as TaskMaster may handle sensitive information related to tasks and schedules.
## What next?
TaskMaster has the potential to grow and evolve into a comprehensive productivity platform with additional features such as automated task prioritization, smart scheduling, and integration with communication tools. To move forward, collaboration with UX/UI designers, software developers, and productivity experts would be valuable in refining and expanding the functionality of TaskMaster.
